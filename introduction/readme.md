## Intended Audience

This guide is intended for backup administrators or consultants managing Veeam

Most sections of this guide assume you already have hands on experience with
Backup & Replication, and will serve as an "advanced user guide", meaning
that more basic usage information, system requirements and the like must be
found in [User Guide in Veeam Helpcenter](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/backup/vsphere).
