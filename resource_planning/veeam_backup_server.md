# Veeam Backup Server
Before installing the Veeam Backup & Replication server, it is important to understand the different data streams generated by the Veeam Backup Service's responsibilities. Additionally there are considerations in regards to system requiments that may affect the desired deployment method.

Depending on component placement, this may affect your decision for where to install the backup server (physical datacenter or different ESXi cluster). It could also mean that you would choose to install additional backup servers in remote locations to optimize restore performance.

All those considerations will be covered in this chapter.
