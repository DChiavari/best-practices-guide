# Veeam Backup Server
Before installing the Veeam Backup & Replication server, it is important to understand the different data streams generated by the Veeam Backup Service's responsibilities. Additionally there are considerations in regards to system requiments that may affect the desired deployment method.

Depending on component placement, this may affect your decision for where to install the backup server (physical datacenter or different ESXi cluster). It could also mean that you would choose to install additional backup servers in remote locations to optimize restore performance.

All those considerations will be covered in this chapter.

## Deployment Method 

You may deploy Veeam Backup & Replication server as either a physical or
virtual server. Depending on the environment, here are some guidelines
that may help deciding which deployment type is the best fit.

### Virtual deployment
If installed in a virtual machine, the VM can be replicated to a
secondary location such as a D/R site. If the virtual machine itself
should fail, or in the event of a datacenter
or infrastructure failure, the replicated VM can be powered on via
the VMware vSphere Client.

### Physical deployment

If installed on a physical machine, the Veeam backup server runs
independently from the virtual platform. This may also be an ideal
solution in case of a disaster in the virtual environment. Should the
physical server itself fail, there are additional steps to take before
reestablishing access to backup repositories and being able to restore.
[FIXME]

In an enterprise environment, it is recommended to install an additional
Veeam backup server to speed up the failover process when it is needed
(it can be co-located with one of the Veeam proxy or repository
servers). If the Veeam Backup Service has to be restored independently
of the Veeam backup server, then back up the Veeam Backup & Replication
configuration and keep a copy in the designated location.
